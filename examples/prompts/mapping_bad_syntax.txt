this is unsolvable because there is a syntax problem, it was missing a right curly bracket:

"""
domain Mapping
{
  Component ::= new (id: Integer, utilization: Real).
  Processor ::= new (id: Integer).
  Mapping   ::= new (c: Component, p: Processor).

  // The utilization must be > 0
  invalidUtilization :- c is Component, c.utilization <= 0.

  badMapping :- p is Processor, 
    s = sum(0.0, { c.utilization |
              c is Component, Mapping(c, p) }), s > 100.

  conforms no badMapping, no invalidUtilization.


model m of Mapping
{
  c1 is Component(0, 10).
  c2 is Component(1, 90).
  p1 is Processor(0).
  Mapping(c1, p1).
  Mapping(c2, p1).
}

partial model pm of Mapping
{
  c1 is Component(0, x).
  c2 is Component(1, y).
  p1 is Processor(0).
  Mapping(c1, p1).
  Mapping(c2, p1).
}
"""

here is the correct and solvable version:

"""
domain Mapping
{
  Component ::= new (id: Integer, utilization: Real).
  Processor ::= new (id: Integer).
  Mapping   ::= new (c: Component, p: Processor).

  // The utilization must be > 0

  badMapping :- p is Processor,

  conforms no badMapping, no invalidUtilization.
}
