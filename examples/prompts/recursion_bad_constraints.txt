This is a bad domain because the constraint is unachievable:
"""
domain RecursionExample
{
  A ::= new (x : Integer).

  // Recursively derive new A's
  A(y) :- A(x), x > 0, y = x - 1.

  // A model is good if it contains exactly 0 A's
  goodModel :- c = count({ a | a is A}), c = 0.

  conforms goodModel.
}

partial model pm of RecursionExample
[solver_RecursionBound = 20]
{
  A(x).
}
"""
The error message is:
"""
Model not solvable. No unsat core terms generated.
"""
Notice that sometimes the Formula system does not provide unsat core terms for unsolvable models.

We modified the constraint in the domain. This is a corrected version:
"""
