      "- Component: Represents a component with an id (Integer) and utilization (Real).\n",

      "The model also includes two constraints:\n",
      "1. `invalidUtilization`: This constraint specifies that the utilization of a Component must be greater than 0.\n",
      "2. `badMapping`: This constraint checks if the total utilization of components mapped to a processor exceeds 100.\n",

      "The `conforms` statement ensures that there are no violations of the `badMapping` and `invalidUtilization` constraints in the model.\n",

      "Now, let's analyze why this formula model is broken and how it can be fixed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The `badMapping` constraint is checking if the total utilization of components mapped to a processor exceeds 100, but the sum is calculated incorrectly. The correct sum should be the sum of utilizations of components mapped to the processor, not the sum of all component utilizations. This can be fixed by updating the sum calculation in the `badMapping` constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The `conforms` statement is used to ensure that there are no violations of constraints, but it is missing the actual constraints to be checked. It should include `no badMapping` and `no invalidUtilization` to enforce the constraints properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The partial model `pm` is incomplete as it does not specify the values of x and y for components c1 and c2 respectively. These values should be provided to create valid instances of components.\n",
