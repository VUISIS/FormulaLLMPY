This can be resolved by introducing a constraint that ensures the total utilization does not exceed 100.\\n\\nSimilarly, the conflict `invalidUtilization` suggests that one or more components have utilization values less than or equal to 50. To resolve this, we can introduce a constraint that ensures all component utilization values are greater than 50.\\n\\nHere's a possible modification to the domain constraints:\\n```diff\\n--- original.dsl     2023-02-20 14:45:00.000000000 +0000\\n+++ modified.dsl    2023-02-20 14:45:01.000000000 +0000\\n@@ -10,4 +10,7 @@\\n   invalidUtilization :- c is Component, c.utilization <= 50.\\n+\\n+validUtilization :- c is Component, c.utilization > 50.\\n\\n  badMapping :- p is Processor, \\n    s = sum(0.0, { c.utilization |\\n@@ -15,6 +18,10 @@\\n      c is Component, Mapping(c, p) }), s > 100.\\n+\\n+totalUtilization :- s = sum(0.0, { c.utilization | \\n+    c is Component, Mapping(c, _) }), s <= 100.\\n\\n  conforms no badMapping, no invalidUtilization, totalUtilization.\\n```\\nIn this modified domain, we added two new constraints: `validUtilization` ensures that all component utilization values are greater than 50, and `totalUtilization` ensures that the sum of utilization values for all components mapped to a processor does not exceed 100.\\n\\nBy introducing these constraints, the partial model should become solvable.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'well done', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Thank you!
